On Thursday and Friday, I was done with 2 main  tasks, 1 done with
coding and 2 done with ordering the parts.

These parts because of the rarety will arive by thursday or friday
until then, I can probably research some more stuff about how this 
harp works indepth. 

Also I plan to make the basic frame that will protect the circuit 
and motor.
