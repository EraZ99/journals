SUMMARY 
i did plenty of things, number one I built my enclosure so that the wiring
looks decent and secondly I ordered the parts, and my last task was to
write my code.
MONDAY
I started writing my code
TUESDAY
I ordered my parts and started writing my code
WEDNESDAY
I build my enclosure to make it look visually appealing
THURSDAY
Started testing my circuit with Mr Davis's Parts, it WORKS!!!!
FRIDAY 
Today I have less to do as my parts will arrive on Tuesday, but still I plan
to check the planed circuit with the parts

CHALLENGE (visually appealing)
Again I have made an enclosure that is sort of pyramid shaped
I have shared my plans and pictures on google drive. :)

BATTERY 
I plan to take the project home so the battery will be attached on SUNDAY 
so that my Project is completed on Monday and can be presentable.
